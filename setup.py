Pip-compatible setup instructions for Antic.

Being a C library with a few dependencies, Antic cannot be sanely
installed with pip from binary builds. It should be installed through a proper
package manager. When this is not possible, it needs to be installed from
source with configure-make-make-install. However, in some scenarios, hiding
this build inside a pip-package is advantageous, e.g., when installing inside a
SageMath source build or when packages have to be installed with a
requirements.txt.
